# Glass Board Pen/Eraser Holder
Jan 2024

The glass board (white board) came with a "tray" that goes at the bottom of the board. We want to move it to the top in order to keep it out of reach of kids and have it be less in the way when writing on the board. I measured the existing design and re-created a similar design but with the tray side reversed.
The design is simple and can be printed on the side with no support or overhangs.

Printed with a brim to make it more steady while printing. Not sure if that was needed.
