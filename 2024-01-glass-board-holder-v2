# Glass board pen holder V2

I wanted a more practical version to store pens than V1. In V1 then pens are still prone to fall out, and it can only handle a few. This new design handles many and looks more like a traditional pen holder. In order to keep it extra secured I made it also attach around a mounting bracket protruding from the board.
